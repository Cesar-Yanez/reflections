how did viewing a diff between two versions of a 
file help you see the bug that was introduced?

viewing a diff help me see the bug looking the
last version that worked before

How could habing easy accesss to the entire history
of a file make you  mor efficent programmer in the
long term?

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually 
choosing when tho create a commit, like you do in
Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like 
Google Docs does?

When manually I have control when to commit by the
other hand with having versions automatically the
software decide when to commit that will generate
various meaningles versions 

Why do you think some versions cotrol systems, like
Git, allow savin multiple files in one commit,
while others, like Google Docs, trat each file 
separately?

Because Git is a coding system oriented and
Google Docs is a multi propouse document version 
control system 

How can you use the commands git log an git diff to 
view the history of files?

using git log you can track all the history of the
changes made in a project files and with git diff
you can compare which changes where made between
two versions

How might using version control make you more confident
to make changes that coluld break something?

If I break something I can easely revert it navigating
through the history of changes
