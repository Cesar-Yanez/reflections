When would you want to use a remote repository rather 
than keeping all your work local?

When working in a different computer an when working with
another person 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather
than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your
remote repository?

Cause pulling manually I have the control over the 
changes I will update

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?

With branches you divide the history of the comits within one
repositiry

Clones you dupllicate one repositoy from a remote location or
from the same computer

With forks you create a copy within github 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state
of the remote stored locally?

Avoiding conflicts between the code you are working locally
and the code thats in the remote repository

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?
What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Without Git or GitHub creating a repository would be 
sligthly easier but tranking changes would be harder
Collaborating without Git or GitHub would be a pain because
it would be imposible to track changes from different 
collaborators
