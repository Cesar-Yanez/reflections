When would you want to use a remote repository rather 
than keeping all your work local?

When working in a different computer an when working with
another person 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather
than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your
remote repository?

Cause pulling manually I have the control over the 
changes I will update
